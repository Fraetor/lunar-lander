# Lunar Lander
A lunar lander game written in python as part the Scientific Computing module of my degree.

## Usage

First install the dependencies with `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

Then run with `python3 main.py`

I have only tested it with Python 3.9.7 and PyGame 2.02, but it should work with anything newer than Python 3.6 and PyGame 2.0.

Gameplay instructions are detailed within the game.

## Background

See [planning.pdf](./planning.pdf) for some of my planning notes.

All code was written by myself, though I did take significant reference from the [PyGame docs](https://www.pygame.org/docs/) (including examples) and [Zac Garby's talk on PyGame](https://zacgarby.co.uk/hacksoc/welcome/).
